\chapter*{\darkblue{The Aquatic Jewish Calendar}}\noindent\darkblue{\large After researching Aquatic Judaism for a personal project, I realized that very little information exists about the group on the Internet. In particular, I couldn't find any examples of the Aquatic Jewish calendar. Accordingly, I decided to make one of my own, with an introduction and helpful notes, in the hope of educating Terrestrial Jews about their Aquatic brethren.\newline\newline The single greatest difference between Terrestrial and Aquatic Judaism is their calendars. The secular (Gregorian) calendar is \textit{solar}: days, months, and years are based on the Earth's movement around the Sun. The Terrestrial Jewish calendar is \textit{lunisolar}: Days are based on the Earth's movement around the Sun, while months and years are based on the phases of the Moon. The Aquatic Jewish calendar is \textit{lunitidal}: Days are based on the local high tides, while months and years are based on the phases of the Moon. The definition of a tidal day is dependent on the regional geography; in Boston Massachusetts, tidal days are \textit{semidiurnal}, meaning the time elapsed between every other high tide. Additionally, Aquatic Jews observe certain holy days that Terrestrial Jews do not, and vice versa; of the holy days they do share, the \textit{manner} in which they are observed often differs.\newline\newline Aquatic Judaism varies by region and denomination in a manner similar to Terrestrial Judaism, but the boundaries between the groups are looser, as befits a people that lives beyond national borders. The notes I've included in this calendar are mostly for Atlantic Aquatic Judaism, which is roughly analogous to Terrestrial Ashkenazi Judaism. \newline\newline The sinusoidal waves on this calendar are based on NOAA preliminary data. For most observant Aquatic Jews, this alone is insufficiently accurate. The prudent Aquatic Jew will listen for the sound of the shofar at hide tide to determine when the day has begun or ended.\newline\newline All images in this calendar are from the Met's open access collection: \texttt{https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection}\newline All tidal data was gathered from the NOAA website: \texttt{https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8443970}\newline This code used to generate this calendar can be found here: \texttt{https://github.com/subalterngames/AquaticCalendar} \newline\newline \textit{- Seth Alter}}\newpage\vphantom{butts}\newpage\normalsize
