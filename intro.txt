\chapter*{\darkblue{The Aquatic Jewish Calendar}}\noindent\darkblue{\large I recently attempted to research Aquatic Judaism for a personal project, but soon realized that almost no information about the religion exists on the Internet. In response, I've created this Aquatic Jewish calendar specifically for Terrestrial Jews, as an educational aid to better understand their Aquatic brethren.\newline\newline The Terrestrial and Aquatic Judaism calendars differ in some crucial respects. The secular (Gregorian) calendar is \textit{solar}: days, months, and years are based on the Earth's movement around the Sun. The Terrestrial Jewish calendar is \textit{lunisolar}: Each month starts at a new moon, and each day starts at sunset. The Aquatic Jewish calendar is \textit{lunitidal}: Each month starts at a new moon, and each day starts at high tide.\newline\newline The sinusoidal waves on this calendar are graphs of predicted tidal heights in Boston, Massachusetts. For most observant Aquatic Jews, this alone is insufficiently accurate. The prudent Aquatic Jew will listen for the sound of the shofar at hide tide to determine when the day has begun or ended.\newline\newline All images in this calendar are from the Met's open access collection:\newline\indent\texttt{https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection}\newline All tidal data was gathered from the NOAA website: \newline\indent\texttt{https://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/webservices/predictions/index.jsp}\newline This code used to generate this calendar can be found here: \newline\indent\texttt{https://github.com/subalterngames/AquaticCalendar}\newline\newline Email me: \newline\indent\texttt{subalterngames@gmail.com}\newline Tweet at me:\newline\indent\texttt{https://twitter.com/subalterngames}\newline My website:\newline\indent\texttt{https://subalterngames.com}\newline\newline\textit{- Seth Alter}}\newpage\vphantom{butts}\newpage\normalsize
