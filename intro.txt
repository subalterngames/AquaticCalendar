\chapter*{\darkblue{The Aquatic Jewish Calendar}}\noindent\darkblue{\large I recently attempted to research Aquatic Judaism for a personal project, but soon realized that almost no information about the religion exists on the Internet. In response, I've created this Aquatic Jewish calendar specifically for Terrestrial Jews, as an educational aid to better understand their Aquatic brethren.\newline\newline The Terrestrial and Aquatic Judaism calendars differ in some crucial respects. The secular (Gregorian) calendar is \textit{solar}: days, months, and years are based on the Earth's movement around the Sun. The Terrestrial Jewish calendar is \textit{lunisolar}: Days are based on the Earth's movement around the Sun, while months and years are based on the phases of the Moon. The Aquatic Jewish calendar is \textit{lunitidal}: Days are based on the local high tides, while months and years are based on the phases of the Moon.\newline\newline Aquatic Judaism varies by region and denomination in a manner similar to Terrestrial Judaism, but the boundaries between the groups are looser, as befits a people that lives beyond national borders. The notes I've included in this calendar are mostly for Atlantic Aquatic Judaism, which is roughly analogous to Terrestrial Ashkenazi Judaism. That being said, Atlantic Aquatic Jews observe many holy days that the Ashkenazim do not, and vice versa; of the holy days that both groups share, their traditions and practices often differ.\newline\newline The sinusoidal waves on this calendar are graphs of predicted tidal heights in Boston, Massachusetts. For most observant Aquatic Jews, this alone is insufficiently accurate. The prudent Aquatic Jew will listen for the sound of the shofar at hide tide to determine when the day has begun or ended.\newline\newline All images in this calendar are from the Met's open access collection: \texttt{https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection}\newline All tidal data was gathered from the NOAA website: \texttt{https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8443970}\newline This code used to generate this calendar can be found here: \texttt{https://github.com/subalterngames/AquaticCalendar} \newline\newline \textit{- Seth Alter}}\newpage\vphantom{butts}\newpage\normalsize
